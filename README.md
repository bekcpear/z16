## About the name

The project name is **整** (Unicode: U+6574; pinyin: zhěng). The number of it's strokes is 16, so I use *z16* as the English name.

**整** is a Chinese character, although it can mean many things, I choose it because it can mean the following:

* do something
* orderly
* neat
* tidy
* and sounds agile
